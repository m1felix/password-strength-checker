# password-strength-checker
This Password Strength Checker project helps evaluate the strength of user-created passwords to ensure they meet security standards. It checks the password against various criteria such as length, complexity, and entropy. By providing feedback on password strength, the tool encourages users to create stronger passwords, reducing the risk of account compromise due to weak or easily guessable passwords.

# Why It's Important:
In cybersecurity, weak passwords are a common vector for attacks such as brute force or credential stuffing. This tool helps users avoid using weak passwords, thereby improving the overall security of their accounts. Password strength is one of the simplest yet most effective defenses against unauthorized access, making it a critical element of online safety.
